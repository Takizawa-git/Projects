		<section>
			<p>This is the modern age of the science and technology. Human civiliazation has been successful in discovery of many new things and among those many things, Internet is the most common one. Internet has become the most common and basic means of communication among the people. It is easy and the quickest means of communication in today's world.</p><br>
			<p>Through the means of internet, people can send information and communicate with people from different places of the world in just and instane. After the discovery of internet, Human life has gotten a lot easier. People are able to make mails, voice messages, video messages to their colleagues and compannions from different pars of the world.</p><br>
			<p>Similarly, My life has been affected alot by the internet. Be it in a positive way or ngative way but it has brought a drastic change in my life. When I was a child, I had no idea what internet was about. As the moments passed and many things were being discovered I happened to be introduced to internet. I still remember the day when my father told me what internet could do. He introduced me to the internet and form that very day, My life wouldn't be the same. After having heard about internet, I was very curious what it actually was so I devoted myself to find more about this thing called internet. I began to visit cyber-cafe & my friends' houses just to spend my time using internet.</p><br>
			<p>As time passed, I got more used to what internet actually was, from being "a child that used to visit cyber to google his favorite cartoon character" to "the teenager studying networking security", I grew up. When I look back at the time, I realise that internet has made this alot better and worse at the same time.<br>
			Internet has been a good medium for me to pass the time. A source for every knowledge from all around the world. A platform where I could learn everything, know the activitites happening in different parts of the world and communicating to the people from oppsite side of the world. Putting these things aside, it has made life alot easier by providing the access to different things from our daily life for instance, online shopping, online movies/shows, online news etc</p><br>
			<p>But along with the positive side of the internet, it has it's defects too. Internet has been affecting in a negative way too. It surely has been an interesting way to kill the time but I might not be aware that it has been consuming my time more than expected. I let myself just go with the flow until the time i realize that it's benn to long using the internet. It has it's dark side too. Not only me, but also all the people are compelled to compare their lifestyle to to others which leads to different serious mental illness. Different criminal activities globally has been taking place and in most of the cases internet stood as the main reason. Internet makes people's mind dull as people dont get time to interact socially with other people and exlore new things. In this way, mmy life has been affected by internet both in positive and negative aspects.
